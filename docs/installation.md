### BTCPay Server

First of all you need a running BTCPay Server instance. If you still don't have one, then [set it up](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/).

### Node-RED

To build your apps visually, you also need to [install Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/), a low-code programming tool for event-driven applications.

### BTCPay Nodes

And finally, to enable interaction between Node-RED and BTCPay Server, [install BTCPay Node](https://github.com/alexk111/node-red-contrib-btcpay#install).
