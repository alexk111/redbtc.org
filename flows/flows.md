For convenience, the flows are divided by 3 categories:

- [Starters](./starters/invoice-creator) - helpful flows to start building your integrations with
- Integrations _(coming soon)_ - simple "If This Then That"-like flows
- Applications _(coming soon)_ - more complex flows with conditional logic and states

## Importing Flows To Node-RED

To import a flow into Node-RED, copy a flow JSON to the clipboard using the `Copy` button on a code block and then import it into Node-RED using the `Import From > Clipboard` menu option or by pressing `Ctrl-I`.
